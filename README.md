<h1>JBox2DTemplate</h1>

Basic Java based physics simulation template using [processing](https://processing.org/) and [jbox2d](https://github.com/jbox2d/jbox2d).  
Simple physics simulations with Rectangle and Circle shapes can be made. I'll try to include other things like Joints, Polygons, 2D Terrain Shapes and Raycasting in the future.  
Works best on Linux, can also be used on Windows with some adjustments, but I've got no idea for apple support.

### Usage
- #### Linux
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`./compile.sh`

- #### Windows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to include appropriate `gluegen-rt-natives-*.jar` and `jogl-all-natives-*.jar` in the `lib` folder.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, you're on your own.
